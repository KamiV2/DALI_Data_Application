#DALI Data Challenge Visualizations

For this portion of the project, I created three visualizations for the provided dataset that encapsulate much of the data provided.

- **Changing Profit Margin Over Time**: This animated visualization shows the profit margin distribution by sale (15-day period) over time (in a histogram), and plots the average profit margin over time in a line plot. Created using Matplotlib. 
- **Sales by Region**: This choropleth visualization shows the sales distribution by region, and plots the total sales by quintile. Data processed in Pandas, choropleth created using Piktochart (I was having some issues installing Matplotlib mapping toolkits on my Mac).
- **Shipping Times Over Time**: This collection of histograms shows the distribution of shipping times over time. Created using Matplotlib.
