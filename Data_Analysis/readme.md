#Data Analysis

In this section, I analysed the data using a neural network I built using Tensorflow. I also added some rudimentary statistical analysis I conducted using chi-squared tests in order to understand potential influence of variables on shipping times.

This file contains two key files:
- StatisticalAnalysis.pdf: This file contains the results of the statistical analysis conducted.
- ShippingTimes.ipynb: This file contains the neural network I built. If the notebook does not run in JupyterNotebook, I've included the link to open it on Google Colab in the notebook.
